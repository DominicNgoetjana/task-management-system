# Task Management API

This project is a simple RESTful API for a Task Management System built with Spring Boot.

## Overview

The Task Management API allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It's built using Spring Boot and uses an H2 in-memory database for data storage.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.6.3 or later

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DominicNgoetjana/task-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd task-management-api
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

- GET `/api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks
- POST `/api/tasks`: Create a new task
- GET `/api/tasks/{id}`: Retrieve a specific task
- PUT `/api/tasks/{id}`: Update a specific task
- DELETE `/api/tasks/{id}`: Delete a specific task

## Usage

Here are some example curl commands to interact with the API:

1. Create a new task:
   ```
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Complete project","description":"Finish the task management API","dueDate":"2023-12-31T23:59:59","status":"TODO"}'
   ```

2. Get all tasks:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks
   ```

3. Get a specific task (replace {id} with the actual task id):
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id}
   ```

4. Update a task:
   ```
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id} -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Updated task","description":"This task has been updated","dueDate":"2023-12-31T23:59:59","status":"IN_PROGRESS"}'
   ```

5. Delete a task:
   ```
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/{id}
   ```
